## Overview

Remedium HMS is a full-featured hospital management platform designed to handle the real complexities of healthcare operations — from patient admission to discharge, pharmacy dispensing, lab testing, surgery scheduling, and revenue tracking.

**What makes it different:**

- **Security-first** — PHI encrypted at rest with Fernet, immutable audit trails, granular RBAC across 13 roles
- **Clinical-grade** — Conflict-aware scheduling, vital signs monitoring, OpenFDA drug lookup
- **Production-ready** — Dockerized, PostgreSQL-compatible, JWT auth, OpenAPI docs
- **Beautiful UI** — Glassmorphic design system with dark mode, animations, and mobile-first responsive layout
